A website where users can post and view poems, as well as receive feedback in the form of likes and comments.
Who are the target audience?  Specifically Poets but anyone can  join and view Poemsy Poems.

# Why is Poemsy Important? 
To create a space where Poets can post their finest work and receive feedback instantly without having to know said people and receiving this feedback from the comfort of anywhere they are at.
